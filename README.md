#README
This is a story sharing site, where users can login, logout, upload, delete and edit stories, they can also upload, edit and delete their comments. If you don't have a user name you can register a new one. You can also view the website as a guest, but you can't edit stories and comments.

Currently, the server can serve three users with password, the login information is in bitbucket user.txt file, you can use that to check.


#Creative Portion:#

1. Design CSS to make the login and upload interface much more beautiful and comfortable. 

2. We add like and dislike buttons for each article allow users to show their attitude about different articles. The guest can see the number of likes and dislikes but they can't press the like and dislike buttons.
